I used pose_hrnet_w48_384x288 pretrained on COCO dataset with 17 joints. The model works irrespective of the direction of the camera except from the back side. For PushUps I used the angle formed by the elbow, for Squats the angle formed by the knees was used and distance between nose and wrists was considered for chin ups.
